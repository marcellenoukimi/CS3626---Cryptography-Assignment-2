# CS3626---Cryptography-Assignment-2
**Problems (total 100 points):**

The aim of this assignment is to implement Playfair cipher. Specifically, your implementation
should have the four functions: Key matrix generator, Preprocessing, Encryption, and
Decryption.

Pre/post conditions for the algorithms can be described as follows:

- _Key (K)_ – **30 points**
    - The key matrix generator takes as input an encryption key and outputs the key matrix KM.
- _Pre (P)_ – **15 points**
    - This function takes as input a plaintext (String type).
    - The preprocessing converts the plaintext into a list of two characters (PL), e.g., “rule” => [“ru”, “le”]
    - If two characters are equal, put an ‘x’ at the middle, e.g., “hello” => [“he”, “lx”, lo”]
    - If the last block has one character, put an ‘x’ at the end, e.g., “sox” => [“so”, “xx”]
    - For your convenience, it is OKAY to change all ‘j’s in the plaintext to ‘i’ in this function.
- 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 (𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃) – **30 points**
    - This function takes as input the key matrix KM and the list of two characters PL.
    - Case 1: If two characters are on the same column, each of which is replaced to a character in the below cell. If a character is located at the bottom, a character in the top cell should be taken.
    - Case 2: If two characters are on the same row, each of which is replaced to a character in the right cell. If a character is located at the rightmost, a character in the leftmost cell should be taken.
    - Case 3: “xx” will not be encrypted. It will be just “xx”.
    - Case 4: Otherwise, two characters are replaced by the others on the other vertices, e.g., List indices of two characters are (0, 4) and (3,1), then each of which is replaced to a character in the (0,1) and (3,4), respectively.
    - The output type should be a list of two characters.
- 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐸𝐸(𝐾𝐾, 𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃) – **15 points**
  - This function takes as input the key matrix KM and the list of two characters CL.
  - Case 1: If two characters are on the same column, each of which is replaced to a character in the above cell. If a character is located at the top, a character in the bottom cell should be taken.
  - Case 2: If two characters are on the same row, each of which is replaced to a character in the left cell. If a character is located at the leftmost, a character in the rightmost cell should be taken.
  - Case 3: “xx” will not be decrypted. It will be just “xx”.
  - Case 4: Otherwise, two characters are replaced by the others on the other vertices, e.g., List indices of two characters are (0, 4) and (3,1), then each of which is replaced to a character in the (0,1) and (3,4), respectively.
  - The output type should be a String.
- _Your program should have some test codes to show the correctness of your implementation_ – **10 points**

Note 1: If you prefer, you can use a list of characters ([‘r’, ‘u’, ‘l’, ‘e’]), rather than a list of two characters ([“ru”, “le”])

Note 2: For the detail of Playfair cipher, please refer page 79.

Note 3: It is recommended to exchange a ciphertext generated by the implementation with your friend and check the decryption algorithm successfully recovers the original plaintext
